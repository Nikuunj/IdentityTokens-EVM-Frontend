## 🔎 Step 1: Find or Create an Issue

- Check existing issues.
- If creating a new one, include:
  - Clear title

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/StabilityNexus/IdentityTokens-EVM-Frontend.git
git remote -v
```

---

## 🌿 Step 6: Create a Feature Branch

---

# 🛠 3️⃣ Project Setup

npm install
```

This installs:

- Next.js 16
- React 19
- Wagmi
- RainbowKit
- Viem
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky
- TailwindCSS

---

## 🔐 Setup Git Hooks

Husky is used for pre-commit hooks.

If needed:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

On commit, lint-staged will automatically:

- Run eslint --fix on JS/TS files
- Run prettier --write

If commit fails, fix errors before retrying.

---

# 🚀 4️⃣ Development Commands

## ▶️ Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs locally (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

---

## 🏗 Build Project

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## 🚀 Start Production Server

```bash
npm run start
```

Build must succeed before PR.

---

# 🧹 5️⃣ Linting & Formatting (MANDATORY)

Before committing:

## 🔍 Run ESLint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## ✨ Format Code

```bash
npm run format
```

## ✅ Check Formatting

```bash
npm run check-format
```

PRs failing lint/format checks may be rejected.

---

# 🎨 Frontend Standards

## 🧱 Architecture Rules

- Use App Router properly (Next.js 16).
- Keep components small and reusable.
- Separate UI and Web3 logic.
- Use custom hooks for contract interactions.
- Avoid deeply nested components.

---

## 🔗 Web3 Integration Rules

Stack includes:

- Wagmi
- Viem
- RainbowKit
- MetaMask SDK
- WalletConnect
- React Query

Ensure:

- Wallet errors are handled.
- Loading states exist.
- Transactions show feedback.
- No private keys are exposed.

Test wallet connection manually before PR.

---

## 🎨 Styling Rules

- Use TailwindCSS v4.
- Avoid inline styles.
- Use tailwind-merge when combining classes.
- Maintain responsive design.
- Keep animations clean (Framer Motion).

---

# 7️⃣ Commit Properly

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: short clear description"
```

Examples:

- feat: add rainbowkit wallet modal
- fix: resolve layout shift issue
- refactor: move web3 logic to hooks
- style: improve button hover states

Avoid vague messages like "update".

---

# 8️⃣ Sync With Upstream

Before pushing:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Resolve conflicts locally.

---

# 9️⃣ Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/short-description
```

---

# 🔟 Open a Pull Request

When opening PR:

- Link issue (Closes #number)
- Explain what changed
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Mention performance impact (if any)

PR must pass CI before review.

---

# ❌ What Causes Rejection

- No assignment
- Failing build
- Lint errors
- Poor code structure
- Breaking wallet flows
- No screenshots for UI changes

---

# 🤝 Code of Conduct
